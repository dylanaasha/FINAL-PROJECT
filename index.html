         <h1> 'Nightmare' Animation directed and produced by Asha Perry</h1>
    
        <p> 'Nightmare' is an animated sequence of a 2D short film in the works called 'Host' about a girl named Akiaya whose life is turned upside when the monsters from her nightmares and night terrors come to life and use her body as a host trapping her in their world. This sequence takes place after Akiaya's mother Kora puts her to bed and Akiaya looks up at the ceiling and sees eyes on her ceiling that start to blink and form into a monster from her nightmare. The finished short fim will be composited in Cinema 4D and Photoshop. It's one of three short films I'm making for my Spring 2022 portfolio. I made this sequence in Procreate on the iPad Pro using an Apple pencil. In total in took about ten hours. My goal for this sequence was to protray many emotions such as, excitement, fear and suprise. Overall I really enjoyed making this sequence and look forward to completing the full short film on a larger drawing tablet making it a lot cleaner. </p>
